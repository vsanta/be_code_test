Problem Description
--------------------
Start building a small Casino app. We’re not looking for a complete app, we’re not even looking for a front end. Rather, we’d like to see how you approach the problem, implement the classes etc.

Main entities:
* Customers who have a certain amount to spend (can be random at first)
* Poker machines & drinks that have a certain cost (can also be random)

Customers can:
* Play poker machines with a chance of winning
* Buy drinks

The app should track (per customer):
* Total spent
* Total won
* Number of wins

Requirements
------------
* gem install bundler
* bundle install

To run tests
-------------
* bundle exec rspec spec
