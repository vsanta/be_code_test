Describe what you would consider the top 3 characteristics of an excellent programmer.
Why are these characteristics important? One or two sentences per characteristic is fine.

1. Quality. That means he/she can build a code that's readable and testable. He doesn't pass on the
opportunity to mercilessly refactor his code and, at the same time, he/she knows how to balance that with
the business needs.

2. Has profound knowledge of the programming language he/she uses. A programmer has to know as much as he/she can about
the technology used to better implement the requirements and produce a clean, stable and performatic application.

3. Codes a product not pieces of software. When you care about the whole your attitude changes. You're able to give better solution to
problems. You know where the core value for your business is.
